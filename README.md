# 1. [English grammar](https://github.com/c4arl0s/OxfordGuideToEnglishGrammar#sentence-and-text)

# Grammatical Units

Word, phase, clause and sentence.

# Word Classes

verb, noun, adjectives, adverb, preposition, determiner, pronoun and conjunction.

# Phases

Verb phrase, noun phrase, adjective phrase adverb phrase and prepositional phrase.

# Sentence Elements

Subject, verb, object, complement and adverbial.

# English compared with other languages.

English words do nor have a lot of different endings for number and gender. Word order is very important in English. The verb phrase can have a complex structure. There are many idioms with prepositions.


A FLIGHT ANNOUNCEMENT
'Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of British Island Airways, Captain Massey and his crew welcome you on board the Start Herald Flight to Southampton. Our flight time will be approximately forty-five minutes, and we shall be climbing to an altitude of eight thousand feet and cruising at a speed of two hundred and fifty miles per hour.'

The grammatical units of English are **words**, **phrases**, **clauses** and **sentences**.

# 1 Words

The words in the announcement are good, evening, ladies, and, gentlemen, on etc.

>For word-building, e.g. air + ways= airways, • 282.
 
# 2 Phrases and clauses

We use phrases to build a clause. Here is an example.

| Subject         | Verb          | Complement                         |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| (noun phrase)   | (verb phrase) | (noun phrase)                      |
| Our flight time | will be       | approximately forty-five minutes.  |
|                 |               |                                    |

1. Here the noun phrase our    flight time is the subject of the clause.
2. A clause has a subject and a verb. 
3. There can be other phrases, too.

In this next example we use a prepositional phrase as an adverbial.

| Adverbial                | Subject       | Verb          | Object        | Object             |
|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| (prepositional phrase)   | (noun phrase) | (verb phrase) | (noun phrase) | (noun phrase)      |
| On behalf of the airline | we            | wish          | you           | a pleasant flight. |
|                          |               |               |               |                    |

For subject, object, complement and adverbial, • 5.
For finite and non-finite clauses, • 239 (3).

# 3 Sentences

A sentence can be a single clause.

On behalf of British Island Airways, Captain Massey and his crew welcome you on board the Start Herald flight to Southampton.

A written sentence begins with a capital letter (On) and ends with a mark such as a full stop.

We can also combine two or more clauses in one sentence. For example, we can use and to link the clauses.

Our flight time will be approximately forty-five minutes, **and** we shall be climbing to an altitude of eight thousand feet **and** cruising at a speed of two hundred and fifty miles an hour.

# III Word Classes

1. There are different classes of word, sometimes called 'parts of speech'. The word come is a verb, letter is a noun and great is an adjective.
>Some words belong to more than one word class. For example, test can be a noun or a verb. He passed the test (noun). He had to test the machine. (verb)

2. There are eight main word classes in English.
  - Verb: climb, eat, welcome, be
  - Noun: aircraft, country, lady, hour
  - Adjective: good, British, cold, quick
  - Adverb: quickly, always, approximately
  - Preposition: to, of, at, on
  - Determiner: the, his, some, forty-five
  - Pronoun: we, you, them, myself
  - Conjunction: and, but, so

>NOTE There is also a small class of words called 'interjections'. They include oh, ah and mhm.

3. Verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs are 'vocabulary words'. Learning vocabulary means learning verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs.
Prepositions, determiners, pronouns and conjunctions belong to much smaller classes. These words are sometimes called 'grammatical words'.

4. Most word classes can be divided into sub-classes. For example:

| Word Classes |                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Verb         | Ordinary verb: go, like, think, apply; Auxiliary verb: is, had, can, must.                                                          |
| Adverb       | Adverb of manner:suddenly, quickly.  Adverb of frequency: always, often. Adverb of place: there, nearby. Linking adverb: too, also. |
| Determiner   | Linking adverb: too, also. Possessive: my, his. Demonstrative: this, that. Quantifier: all, three.                                  |

# Phrases

There are five kinds of phrase.

1. **Verb phrase**: come, had thought, was left, will be climbing

2. Noun phrase: a goodflight, his crew, we 

A noun phrase has a noun (flight), which usually has a determiner (a) and/or adjective (good) in front of it. A noun phrase can also be a pronoun (we).

3. Adjective phrase: pleasant, very late

An adjective phrase has an adjective, sometimes with an adverb of degree (very).

4. Adverb phrase: quickly, almost certainly
